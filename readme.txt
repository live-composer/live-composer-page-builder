== Installation ==

Install and Activate our page builder from your WordPress admin like any other plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I activate the page builder on a page? =

When you visit a page you'll see a green "activate editor" button in the bottom right corner, click that, and the page will reload with page builder ready to use.

= Why is the "activate editor" button missing from the homepage =

In most of the cases, this is because the homepage is not a real WordPress page, it's custom content generated by the theme's index.php. Publish a new page and set it as the homepage ( WP Admin > Settings > Reading > Front Page ). Now you can use a page builder on the homepage too.
