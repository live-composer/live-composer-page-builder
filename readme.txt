== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to I activate the page builder on a page? =

When you visit a page you'll see a green "activate editor" button in the bottom right corner, click that and the page will reload with page builder ready to use.

= Why is the "activate editor" button missing from the homepage =

In most of the cases, this is because the homepage is not a real WordPress page, it's custom content generated by the theme's index.php. Publish a new page and set it as the homepage ( WP Admin > Settings > Reading > Front Page ). Now you can use page builder on the homepage too.

= 1.0.7 - March 5th 2016 =

While we are working on major JavaScript optimizations our designer prepared a minor plugin update with a few UI improvements.

To make sure new page builder users understand how to edit pages in Live Composer we added a few helpful buttons and Page Builder tab on page editing screen.

Custom Post Types now also has a link that open selected template for editing in Live Composer.
Page listing in WordPress admin panel now also has a link to activate Live Composer.

= New Getting Started Screen =

In the new Live Composer page builder update, we changed the location of the Welcome Screen. Now it's called Getting Started and located in plugin settings. We decided to make this screen always accessible as it has important information on where to find Live Composer documentation and how to get our one-to-one email support.

We also working hard on improving our email list. We are going to send regular updates on the plugin development process and new releases. The new welcome screen includes email subscription form and our social badges.

= No More Tutorials by Default =

Tutorials is a great feature but mostly used by theme developers to introduce users to the Live Composer layout builder. We decided to disable this feature by default to improve settings panel and not confuse new page builder users from WordPress.org.

If you need this feature back, just add the next line into your theme's functions.php file:

add_filter( 'dslc_tutorials', '__return_true' );


= What We are Working On =

* Our developers work hard to improve interface speed and stability. They rewrite some functions on pure JS and optimize code to make it use fewer browser resources and work faster.
* Our designer is working on UI redesign to make layout builder more native to WordPress users. We also want to improve the structure of the module options panel soon.
* Support: We also changed the way support works. Forum closed for new postings. All the new support request are served via one to one email conversations.
* Marketing and PR were neglected for a long time. Now we have experience and resources to give the front-end editor attention it deserves.
* Community: we are going to invest our time into creating a strong community of users and developers around this plugin. First of all, we will promote and grow our Facebook Group. It will be used by theme users like you to share success stories, web site designs, find new clients, ask questions.
* Brand: we hired an amazing Japanese illustrator to design a new mascot for our drag and drop website builder. We want to be more friendly and open to the users and not look too serious. Creating websites is a great fun!
* Marketplace: this is one of the most important aspects for a long time success of our plugin. Our developers work on new powerful extensions and landing pages integrations. We are also working on amazing opportunities for 3-rd party developers, to make it easy for them to develop and sell their extensions on our website. Keep tuned, we will make you rich :)

= Join Our New [Facebook Group] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/livecomposer/) =

It's a great experience for us to support you via our new one-to-one support channel. We learn a lot on how you use visual composer for your business. To share your experience with our drag and drop plugin and learn about other users creations we created a new Facebook Group for Live Composer.  Please, join us and other site creators to share your latest project or get a quick advice on website building.

Yoast SEO v3 Compatibility

Version 3.0 of Yoast SEO came with a lot of changes and one of them was they completely rewrote the way the keyword analysis is handled. Our front end website builder is now compatible with that new keyword analysis system.

Aside of the compatibility we've improved the data website builder generates for the purpose of Yoast SEO analysis, it will now include HTML elements instead of just plain text, so when Yoast checks for headings, images it will find them.

However, for your existing website builder created pages you will need to activate the editor and our landing page builder will then regenerate that content and show the "Publish Changes" button, press it.

= Notification Module - Show Again After =

Until now the notification module was quite simple, the user can close it but it would show up again when page reloaded. Now you can set it on a timer, you can set the amount of days that will take after the visitors closes it to be shown the notification again.

= Jetpack's Photon Compatibility =

Jetpack has a feature called Photon which makes the images be stored on Jetpack's server instead of your own server, making things a bit faster and saving up on your bandwidth.

But it was not compatible with our layout builder since the image resizing functionality in visual composer needed the images to be on the same server in order to resize them. Now, front end site builder will use Photon's functions to handle the display of resized images.

= Improvements in frontend layout builder code =

* Button Module - Now supports opening videos ( youtube and vimeo ) in a lightbox
* Blog/Posts Modules - Option to ignore sticky posts
* Text/HTML/Content Modules - Box shadow options added for buttons
* Clicking an image ( if lightbox activated ) in a gallery will now open that image instead of the first one in the gallery
* Info Box Module - Letter spacing option added for title
* Button Module - Letter spacing option added
* Image Module - Negative bottom margin now possible
* Widgets Module - Margin Left option added

= Fixes =

* Staff Social Module was broken
* Issue with blockquote align option in HTML/Text/Content modules
* Issue with masonry layout breaking
* Issue with navigation module showing above lightbox
* Issue with social shares count being incorrect
* Issue with border radius on thumbnail in all posts related site builder modules
* Issue with content of a post type being displayed on the archives of the post type

Text Shadow

A new option type has been added to front end website builder, it's text shadow. it's been added to several modules ( Text, Content, HTML, Title, Meta, Excerpt, Icon ) and we'll keep adding it to more modules in upcoming releases.

New Feature - "Currently Editing"

When editing a row or a module, above the options ( left side ) will be a little bar with the text "Currently Editing: Blog Module" so you know which module are you editing. Also, clicking that bar will scroll the browser to the module you are editing and the border around it will flash to point out which one is it.

New Feature - "Load More" Pagination

If you want AJAX powered pagination ( click "load more" and more posts show up ), now you can have that, just set the "Pagination Type" option to "Load More". This is available for all the posts related page builder modules.

New Elements - Social Sharing in Blog Module

If you'd like to put social sharing links in your blog posts listing now you can, you can enable it under Styling > Post Elements, you'll see "Social" in there.

New Feature - Icon Sets

Icon sets is a new feature which allows developers to implement new icons that will be available in drag-and-drop visual editor. For each icon option in top right the current set being used is shown and clicking on it allows you to change the set being used.

New Shortcode - Category Description

If you are using layout builder to power the archives/category pages and want to display the category description, now you can, simply add a text module and add the [dslc_category_description] shortcode to output it.

Improvements in drag-and-drop page editor code
* Info Box Module - Option to add an image just below the icon. This is useful if you want to use an image instead of an icon. ( thanks to Aman )
* Blog and Posts Modules - Option to turn off author/date in the meta independently
* All posts related modules - Option to change thumbnail align
* All posts related modules - Option to change align ( left/center/right ) on thumbnail
* Several animations in the editor have been switched over from JS to CSS

Bugs
* The placeholder text on Info Box module was wrong and confusing
* The avatar shortcode was echoing instead of returning
* Parallax functionality was affecting horizontal position of BG image

For Developers

New landing page cretor Modules Option Type - Text Shadow

To use this option in your own modules simply set the type of the option to text_shadow. If you are applying a default value to the option then use the usual order of parameters "horizontal vertical blur color".

New Function - dslc_get_social_count()

it's used to get the amount of shares the current post/page has on twitter, facebook and pinterest. It returns an array with keys "fb", "twitter", "pinterest".

It accepts 2 parameters, first is the post ID ( in case you want to get social shares of a specific post/page instead of the current one ) and the second one is cache time in milliseconds ( how long until it should recheck again for the shares count, defaults to 3600 seconds, which is of course 1 hour ).

New Filters - Custom Post Type and Taxonomy Arguments

All the arguments for post types and taxonomies now have filters so you can alter them. This was asked by a developer so he can change the labels ( "Projects", "Add Project" ) to something else that suits his theme better, but you can also change other arguments with this.

Here's the list of filters: dslc_projects_cpt_args, dslc_projects_cats_args, dslc_downloads_cpt_args, dslc_downloads_cats_args, dslc_downloads_tags_args, dslc_galleries_cpt_args, dslc_galleries_cats_args, dslc_partners_cpt_args, dslc_partners_cats_args, dslc_staff_cpt_args, dslc_staff_cats_args, dslc_testimonials_cpt_args, dslc_testimonials_cats_args

For the list of arguments you can check the source code or check the register_post_type() and register_taxonomy().

[Check out the blog post about 1.0.4 release](https://livecomposerplugin.com/blog/version-1-0-4-released/)

= 1.0.3 - October 2nd 2015 =

This is an unscheduled update, the next scheduled regular update is still planned for October 15th. The purpose of this update is to make our frontend page editor compatible with WordPress language packs, more info on language packs can be found at https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/

The text domain for visual composer used to be ds_string but for the language packs feature to work it has to be the same as the plugin's folder name which is live-composer-page-builder. So in this update all the textual strings have the text domain changed ( about 8500 strings ) and some other fixes related to the translation capabilities have been made.

If you have your own translation of our frontend page editor the file name is something like dslc_string-sr_RS which will no longer work, change it to live-composer-page-builder-sr_RS ( the sr_RS part depends on the language code ).

= 1.0 - September 10th 2015 =

* Wordress.org RE-RELEASE


= 1.2.4.1 (July 30th, 2015) - released on CodeCanyon before moving to WordPress.org =


= Improvements in landing page generator code =

* Info Box Module - Responsive options added for wrapper
* New shortcode to display the avatar of the current user: [dslc_user_avatar] Accepts size parameter ( ex. [dslc_user_avatar size=200] will be 200px avatar )

= Bugs =

* Issue with row actions ( save/cancel ) still visible if you click to edit a module while a row is being edited
* The "Orientation" option in all posts visual composer modules was broken
* ID of the comments div in the comments module was wrong so WordPress generated URLs with #comments did not jump to comments
* Issue with layout builder modules not showing in Internet Explorer when an opacity related animation is applied
* Options not shown in an "edge case" scenario when there's only one option



= 1.2.4 (July 23rd, 2015) - released on CodeCanyon before moving to WordPress.org =

= Save Draft =

A lot of our front end website builder users click the "Publish Changes" button often to make sure if something unexpected happens they don't lose the content they created. But when working on a live page ( visitors have access to it ) that's not something you'd want to do, you want to publish only when the page is finished.

That's where drafts come in. On the right of the "Publish Changes" button is a new button called "Save Draft". Clicking that will save your changes but not publish them ( not visible to visitors ).

This is also useful if you're working on a page but got to stop for some reason. You save the changes as a draft and you can then safely disable the visual editor. When you enable it again the changes will still be there.

= Bigger Changes =

* Builder Performance/Speed

Those who experienced slow response while building ( changing tabs, loading module options... ) should see a significant improvement in response time. The 5000+ lines of code that powers the page building process has been refactored, a lot of it improved and some of it rewritten.
* Module Width

Front end site builder modules are no longer limited to 100% width of the modules area. Front-end modules now have the same width options as module areas do, allowing more flexibily in creating layouts. The interface is the same as for module areas, just click the icon and set the width.

* For developers using our landing page builder - The "General" tab is no longer required. If there are no options under that tab it won't show up.

* You can set a default header and footer which will be used accross the website.

* All fonts now load with one single call instead of one call per font.
* Tutorial CSS and JavaScript files now load only when needed.

If you set that in your theme's functions.php, when our website builder 1.0.5.2 is released it won't show up until you change it to 1.0.5.2 ( or greater ).



= 1.0.5 - released on CodeCanyon before moving to WordPress.org =

= Bigger Changes =

* Archive Creation
Front-end Page Builder is expanding it's influence, you can now create archive ( ex. category ) pages with it as well. In WordPress Admin > Live Composer > Archive Setting you can set which page should be used as the archive page. All the posts modules will automatically show the correct category when used on an archive page.
* Styling Presets
Best way to explain it is with an example. Let's say you use the text module with the same styling on multiple pages and you decide to change the styling. You'd need to change each of those text modules separately, which takes more time than it should. Not anymore, you can now apply presets to modules and then changes to one of those modules will automatically apply to all the other ones that uses that preset. You will find the presets options in each module under Styling > Presets.
* Size of LC visual editor generated data
The size of the data generated by front end page Page Builder ( all the info about builder modules on a page ) has been drastically reduced, up to 95% from what it used to be.
* Translation Compatibility
Live Composer layout builder wasn't fully translatable ( to be honest most of it wasn't translatable ), but that's fixed now, you can properly translate it to your language. Much of the code had to be changed in order to achieve this but it's worth it.
